# Screens

This folder contains the actual layout of the UI for the entire application. It can further be distributed into two or three folders.

-   onboarding : the flash screen and onboarding pages such as login/sign-up screen.
-   general : the home screen and other generally used screens.
-   the screens that are not that important.
